# => Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm is a graph analysis algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph 
# => with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles) and also for finding transitive closure 
# => of a relation R. A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths 
# => between all pairs of vertices, though it does not return details of the paths themselves.
